Following the tradition, darktable 3.0 was released for Christmas.
After a lot of renewal in 2018, 2019 has seen many very unexpected
changes in darktable, both in its user interface and in its internal
mechanisms.

The announcement and release notes for this new release can be found

Among the new major features:

As with all darktable major release, this version changes the database
format so it is not possible to downgrade to previous versions after
launching darktable 3.0: don't forget to make a backup of your
database (`~/.config/darktable/` directory) before upgrading.
