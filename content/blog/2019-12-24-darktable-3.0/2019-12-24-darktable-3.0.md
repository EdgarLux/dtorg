Following the tradition, darktable 3.0 was released for Christmas.
After a lot of renewal in 2018, 2019 has seen many very unexpected
changes in darktable, both in its user interface and in its internal
mechanisms.

The announcement and release notes for this new release can be found
here:
[https://www.darktable.org/2019/12/darktable-30-released/](https://www.darktable.org/2019/12/darktable-30-released/).

Among the new major features:

* A whole new GUI, fully reworked to be controlled by GTK+ CSS rules. There is no more size, color, position in Gtk C code, which makes the whole GUI themable. This version comes with several themes.
* A new timeline view, making possibility to select a date range to display related images
* A new *culling* mode has been added to the lightable view. It displays a fixed number of consecutive images starting from the first selected, and allows you to pan & zoom them. The number of displayed images can be set by the user, and they can be navigated with the mouse wheel and keyboard.
* A new *filmic RGB* module which, like the previous *filmic*, is designed to replace ‘base curve’, ‘shadows and highlights’ and other global tone-mapping modules. This new version should be easier to use, and it will reduce color casts. The old ‘filmic’ module is now deprecated and is only available on images where it was already used for editing.
* A new *tone equalizer* module is designed to merge the features of *zone system*, *shadows and highlights*, and (local) *tone mapping* modules in a scene-referred RGB space. It brings an easy and safe way to remap tones locally, performing a quick zone-based dodging and burning using Ansel Adam’s zone system logic.
* A new *raster mask*, a copy of a parametric mask that allow possibility to apply this mask on whole modules in the pixel-pipe.
* A new *3D lut* module, for handling 3D RGB Lut transformations (PNG Hald-CLUT and Cube files are supported).
* Many improvements have been made on the *denoise (profiled) module*.
* A new *rgb curve* module has been added. It has modes for linked and independent RGB channels. 
* A new *rgb levels* module has been added. It has linked and independent channels, preserve colors option and is native RGB.
* A new *basic adjustments* module has been added. It allows to adjust the black level, exposure, highlight compression, contrast, middle grey, brightness and saturation. It also has an auto feature based on Rawtherapee’s auto levels that can work on the entire image or a user selected area.
* A complete rework of the tagging module have been made. It is now faster and more complete, with a new hierarchical view, possibility to designate tags private or by categories or even search synonyms.
* Export module have now an option to select which metadata to export. 
* A quite extensive rewrite of the lighttable view (including the filmstrip in darkroom view) has been made to greatly improve the overall performance. The lighttable is now usable on 4K and 5K monitors. darktable 3.0 also brings many code optimizations for CPU and SSE paths.
* And many other minor (but useful) features have been added. We will talk about them at the end of this article.

As with all darktable major release, this version changes the database format so it is not possible to downgrade to previous versions after launching darktable 3.0: as it's always advisable to make a backup of your database (`~/.config/darktable/` directory) before upgrading, darktable 3.0 had introduced an automatic backup of your darktable 2.6 or previous database. This has been introduced especially because darktable 3.0 introduced so many changes, and particularly a whole rework of pixel-pipe order.

# Major features

## A whole new complete CSS themable GUI

darktable 3.0 introduce now a more modern and completely themable GUI by CSS. With that whole rework, four themes have been introduced :

* darktable: the default theme


* darktable-elegant-darker: a quite dark theme (similar to default theme but with more condensed fonts)


* darktable-elegant-dark: lighter version


* darktable-elegant-grey: even lighter version


Elegant themes need Roboto fonts installed to have the awaited experience they brings.

You will also find these four themes with icons version. These themes only add original icons on modules in darkroom right panel. So if you want to keep icons there, use icons versions.
