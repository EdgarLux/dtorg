TODO: intro.

Among the new major features:

* A new "retouch" module, similar to the "spot removal" module with
  smart cloning ("heal") and ability to act on each level of detail
  individually.

* A new "filmic" module, able to manage most aspects of the tone of an
  image in a single module.

* A complete rework of the "color balance" module, which can now be
  seen as a color-aware variant of "levels", and can do most
  adjustments automatically thanks to new color picker buttons.

* The ability to guide the bluring of the blend mask, to select an
  object precisely with minimal effort.

# Major features

## A new module: "retouch"

While darktable is primarily focused on raw development, recent
versions introduced features like "liquify", traditionally available
only in pixel-oriented editors like GIMP. One more important step in
this direction is done with the new "retouch" module, which
essentially supersedes "spot removal", together with
frequency-splitting editing for fine retouch.

### Improvements compared to spot removal

The interface has a lot more buttons than "spot removal", but
everything you could do with the later is also possible in a similar
way with retouch.

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch module overview]({filename}rt-overview.png)
  </div>

Just like with "spot removal", you may select a shape (circle,
ellipse, path, or brush, which wasn't available with "spot removal") and
click on a part of the image you want to hide. The module will clone
another part of the image to hide it. Drag instead of clicking to
choose the source of the clone, or adjust the controls after the fact.

Many details will make your life easier than before:

#### Seamless cloning, better results with less efforts

By default, the clone uses a "seamless cloning" algorithm (borrowed
from GIMP's "heal" tool), which adapts the source to the context
where it is cloned. You don't need to clone *exactly* the right
piece of image. Let's take a common example: a small defect in a
not-completely-uniform sky:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch example]({filename}rt-original.png)
  </div>

A bad attempt to fix this with the clone tool would give:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch clone (with controls)]({filename}rt-clone.png)
  </div>

The piece of sky copied to mask the defect is a bit darker than the
place where it's copied. It's not obvious while the controls are
displayed on the image, but the final image is really bad:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch clone (without controls)]({filename}rt-clone-nocontrol.png)
  </div>

The same retouch with the new "heal" tool
(![heal tool]({filename}rt-heal-icon.png)) gives this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal (with controls)]({filename}rt-heal.png)
  </div>

This time, the final image is undistinguishable from a real sky
without defect:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal (without controls)]({filename}rt-heal-nocontrol.png)
  </div>

Even when cloning pieces of images of totally different colors, the
"heal" tool behaves surprisingly well. Let's push the module a bit:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Retouch heal on different colors]({filename}rt-heal-red-white-blue.png)
  </div>

The white patch is cloned to the blue shirt, the blue shirt to the red
one, and the red one to the white one. Each time, the local contrast
is kept, but the overall color and luma of the patch is adapted to fit
the destination.

The basic "clone" tool (![clone tool]({filename}rt-clone-icon.png)) is
still available for the rare cases where you would want it.

#### Fill and blur, when you don't have anything to clone

In addition to the "clone" and "heal" tools (which work only when you
have a piece of image to duplicate on the spot to remove), retouch
provides a "fill" tool (![fill tool]({filename}rt-fill-icon.png))
(fill a shape with a color) and a "blur" tool
(![blur tool]({filename}rt-blur-icon.png)) (apply a blur to soften a
part of the image tools). These tools are most useful for
split-frequency editing, see below.

#### One activation, multiple strokes: continuous add

Tools can be activated once for multiple strokes. Just use
Control-click on one of the point, line, ellipse or path tool
(instead of a normal click), and the tool will remain active until
you explicitly deactivate it. This is very convenient when fixing
many spots on the same image, compared to the previous flow where
one had to re-click the tool's button for each stroke.

#### Source patch visualization

For "clone" and "heal" tools, each stroke consists in a source and a
destination. With a simple click, one sets the destination and by
default darktable picks an arbitrary location for the source. One can already
set both source and destination with a simple mouse action by dragging
from destination to source.

Retouch introduces a more advanced mechanism:

* While moving the mouse over the image, the future destination is
  marked with its shape, and the source is marked with a small cross:

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![Retouch source and destination]({filename}rt-source-cross.png)
  </div>

* To select a source, use Shift-click on the image. The cross is
  placed at the mouse location and won't move until you select the
  destination, with a simple click. This is interesting combined with
  the permanent activation of the tool mentioned above: the source
  for multiple strokes will be located at the same place, relative to
  the destination.

* A variant: use Control-Shift-Click instead of Shift-Click. This also
  sets the source location, but this time it will remain fixed in
  absolute coordinate instead of relative to the destination.

### Split-frequency editing

A common issue with photo retouching, typically for portrait, is that
you want to hide spots, and sometimes reduce local contrast to make
the skin appear softer, but keep the skin's texture. A brutal blur
would make the skin overly soft and will give at best an "obviously
post-processed" look. Let's take this image as an example (taken from
a
[pixls.us PlayRaw contest](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/playraw-hillbilly-portrait/5518):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait]({filename}rt-overall-portrait.jpg)
  </div>

A common technique for this kind of retouching is to split the image
into several images corresponding to different levels of details, and
then combine the images together. This is what [GIMP's
wavelet decompose plugin](https://pixls.us/articles/skin-retouching-with-wavelet-decompose/)
does, for example. After splitting, one gets a blurry image
corresponding to the coarse details, and one or several images
containing details only. In our example, we get:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait]({filename}rt-portrait-scale4.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 5]({filename}rt-portrait-scale5.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 6]({filename}rt-portrait-scale6.jpg)
  </div>

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Example portrait, scale 7]({filename}rt-portrait-scale7.jpg)
  </div>

This kind of transformation is used internally by the "equalizer"
module, which allows you to increase or decrease the importance of
each level of detail in the image. While "equalizer" works globally on
the image, "retouch" allows you to select the level of detail and the
portion of image you want to work with.

In the retouch module, this corresponds to the "wavelet decompose"
part of the GUI:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Wavelet decompose scales]({filename}rt-scales.png)
  </div>

This part shows one rectangle per scale (fine-grained on the left,
coarse-grained on the right). The dark rectangle on the left
corresponds to the full image, and the white one on the right to the
residual image, i.e. the image where all other levels of details have
been removed. By default, darktable always shows the final image, but
you can visualize the details scales and residual image by clicking
the "display wavelet scales
(![Display wavelet scales icon]({filename}rt-display-wavelet-scales.png))
button. The currently selected image appears with a red rectangle.
Move the bottom slider to change the number of details scales to use.
Depending on the zoom level, some details scale may be finer than your
screen resolution, hence unusable. The grey line above the scales
shows which scales are visible at the current zoom level.

When viewing the details scales, contrast may be too weak or too
strong so the module proposes a levels adjustment (which apply only on
the on-screen preview, not on the final image):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Levels adjustment]({filename}rt-levels.png)
  </div>

Each of the tools presented above (heal, clone, fill, blur) is usable
on any of these scales. Think of them as layers obtained from the
source image, and re-combined together after retouching to obtain the
final image. This is where "fill" and "blur" tools make most sense:
"fill" defaults to an erase mode where the fill color is black, which
corresponds to remove the details when used on details scales. One can
also pick a color and fill with this color (most useful on the
residual image scale). Using "blur" directly on the image usually
results in clearly visible post-processing, but using it selectively
on scales results in very subtle effects.

#### Example 1: spot reduction instead of spot removal

Let's focus on the spot below the glasses. If we want to completely
remove it, it's pretty easy to do so with the "heal" tool. Now, what
happens if we decide that we want to keep it, but reduce it to avoid
drawing the attention. We can just remove it from the coarse detail
scale (scale 6 in our example). The spot is no longer visible on the
residual image, so removing it from the details scale is sufficient.
The "heal" tool allows us to do that cleanly, but when dealing with
the details scale, the "fill" and "blur" tools can also give good
results. Here's the result on scale 6 (before on the left, after on
the right):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6]({filename}rt-before-after-scale6.jpg)
  </div>

The final image will be transformed as follows:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6 (final image)]({filename}rt-before-after-final.jpg)
  </div>

Now, we may decide that the healing we did on scale 6 should also be
applied on scale 5. We can redo the same thing manually, but we can
also use the top slider, called "merge scale", to automatically
replicate shapes to multiple scales. Any shape created on the right
hand side of this slider will be replicated on all finer scales up to
the merge slider (except if the slider is completely set to 0, which
means deactivate the merging). By setting the slider to 5, we apply
our healing to both scales 5 and 6, and get the following:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after at scale 6]({filename}rt-merge-5-6.jpg)
  </div>

If we move the slider further to the left, the spot disapears
progressively. Using the same principle, we can remove marks on the
skin while preserving the hair of the beard:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Before/after, preserving beard]({filename}rt-beard-preserve.jpg)
  </div>

(Just one "heal" shape on scale 7, propagated to scale 5 using the
merge slider)

#### Example 2: playing with the skin's texture

If we want to change the texture of the skin on the cheek, we can
apply a blur on a shape like this:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Blur on a detail scale]({filename}rt-blur-detail.jpg)
  </div>

and get the following before/after result:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Changing the skin texture]({filename}rt-skin-texture.jpg)
  </div>

Obviously, this kind of retouching should be done with great care:
when pushed too far, one gets an overly artificial look. When unsure,
you can always get back to your retouch and use blending with an
opacity lower than 100%, or change the opacity or blur radius of each
shape individually.

#### Example 3: having fun with the residual image

Just for fun (do not reproduce at home, ugly images to be expected!),
we can get a tatoo effect by using the clone tool on the residual
image:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}rt-clone-residual-image.jpg)
  </div>

While not really elegant, this example illustrates the
"split-frequency" principle: we've kept the fine details from the
cheek, and cloned the coarse ones in the residual image.

## Edge-aware bluring for blend masks

The "blend" feature of darktable allows selecting a part of the image,
called the mask, and applying the transformation of a module
selectively to this part. After creating a mask (drawn, parametric),
one can soften the edges of this mask with a bluring.


darktable 2.6 gives you more control on the way mask bluring is
performed. To understand how it works, let's look at the two main
kinds of bluring. The common one is "gaussian blur", and gives roughly
the same effect as an incorrectly focused photo. In gaussian blur, the
value (luma and chroma) of each pixel is spread uniformly to the
neighbouring pixels. The influence of a pixel reduces with the
distance. In darktable, gaussian bluring is available in the lowpass
module:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}gaussian-blur.jpg)
  </div>

Another very useful kind of bluring is the
[bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter),
sometimes called "surface bluring" (because of the name of the
corresponding tool in Photoshop), or edge-aware bluring. In this mode,
the value of each pixel is spread to the neighbouring pixels, but the
influence of a pixel is also reduced when the pixels have different
values. For example:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cloning on the residual image]({filename}edge-aware-blur.jpg)
  </div>

A similar bluring algorithm can be applied to the mask, but this time
the mask is blured, and the image being processed serves as a blur
guide. This allows doing a very rough approximation of a mask, and
refining precisely with the sliders.

Suppose we want to improve the color of the sky. In the "color zones"
module, we can select the sky approximately with a drawn mask:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask.jpg)
  </div>

Obviously, a gaussian blur on this mask (i.e. the only available with
darktable 2.4) only makes things worse:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask-gauss.jpg)
  </div>

However, pushing the "feathering radius" slider, the mask
automatically adjusts to the sky, without spreading to the mountains.
The feathering reduced the opacity of the mask a little, but we can
compensate this with the "mask opacity" slider. And voilà:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Drawn mask]({filename}gb-mask-feather.jpg)
  </div>

Note that by pushing the "feathering radius" and "mask opacity"
sliders, one gets a tool similar to the "magick wand" selection of
GIMP, often requested by darktable users: select a few pixels inside
an area to select, and let the tool select surrounding similar pixels.
For example, a brush stroke inside the house:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Brush, without feathering]({filename}gb-brush-nofeather.jpg)
  </div>

And now with feathering:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Brush, with feathering]({filename}gb-brush-feather.jpg)
  </div>

# Lighttable and map improvements

* Search for the map view should work better.
  TODO: details?

* The look of the lighttable has been improved. The background text
  showing the image format was often unreadable because it was hidden
  by the picture. The state of the local copy is now displayed in the
  top right corner.

* One can now sort images by aspect ratio (possibly after croping
  within darktable):

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Sort by aspect ratio]({filename}lt-sort-by.png)
  </div>

* It is also possible to specify the order manually, by selecting
  "custom sort" and then drag-and-dropping the images to reorder them:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Custom sort]({filename}lt-custom-sort.png)
  </div>

* Collections can be filtered by aspect ratio, shutter speed
  (exposure) and state of local copy:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Collection filters]({filename}lt-collection-filters.png)
  </div>

* When selecting a filter to collect images, the number of images
  corresponding to each filter is displayed. In the example below, 13
  images were taken at 1/2000 and 27 at 1/1600:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Number of images per collection]({filename}lt-collection-nb.png)
  </div>

2. amélioration visuelle de la table lumineuse, code couleur, type image, état de copie locale, possibilité d'afficher des informations directement sur la miniature

3. possibilité d'avoir des ascenseur sur la table lumineuse ou sur la table lumineuse et la chambre noire
11. amélioration du support de turboprint (choix du type de papier, dialogue turboprint complet affiché avant impression) 
30. meilleur support des groupes (étoiles, notes sur toutes les photos regroupées)
31. ajout un tri par groupe de photo
28. différents types de sélection pour les tags hiérarchiques dans le module collection

## Ratio-preserving crop in the perspective correction module

The perspective correction module now allows a semi-automatic cropping
preserving the original image's format:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Automatic croping to original format]({filename}pc-original-format.png)
  </div>

Just drag the mouse over the image to select the portion to crop:

  <div style="text-align: center">
![Cropping an image]({filename}pc-crop-image.jpg)
  </div>

The area is adjusted automatically to avoid including black parts in
the target image. This avoids having to switch to the "crop and
rotate" module.

# Usability improvements

## Contextual help

## Module organisation into tabs

TODO

## Import/export to other software

10. amélioration de l'import Lr (“creator”, “rights”, “title”, “description”, “publisher”)
33. nouveau script pour récupérer les collections de Capture One Pro

## Other improvements

* More widgets are themable through CSS. In particular, some widgets
  hardcoded a light foreground and black background so it was not
  possible to make a clean white background theme.

* 50%, 400%, 800% and 1600% zoom level are available in darkroom mode.
  While most operations provided by darktable are meant to improve the
  overall image tone and colors, it is sometimes interesting to get a
  precise pixel-level view of a small part of the image. The highest
  zoom factor previously available (200%) was not always sufficient,
  especially on high-dpi screens. Note that these zoom levels are
  available from the menu in the preview area, but not with mouse
  wheel.

  <div style="text-align: center">
  ![1600% Zoom Level]({filename}zoom-1600.png)
  </div>

* All masks are previewed and can be adjusted before being drawn. This
  also applies to the "liquify" module's shapes.

* The color picker's behavior has been reworked.
